%description
Junk Mail Buffering Agent (JMBA) is designed to queue potentially unwanted
email until the sender's email address has been verified, at which point the
original email is delivered.

JMBA is designed to be used in conjunction with a spam filter such as QSF
(http://www.ivarch.com/programs/qsf.shtml).  When the spam filter says it
thinks an email is spam, it can be passed to JMBA.  JMBA will queue it and
send an email to the sender containing a key; if the sender replies, the
original email is "unfrozen" from the queue and delivered.
